		<h2>UNDERWATER</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Sea turtles, members of the Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae families, are marine reptiles that inhabit tropical and subtropical waters. Known by types such as the green turtle, loggerhead turtle, hawksbill turtle, flatback turtle, and leatherback turtle, sea turtles can grow into large animals and play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem.</p>

		<p>Sea turtles breathe using lungs and need to surface to take a breath, although some species can hold their breath for quite a long time. During the nesting season, female sea turtles return to the beaches where they were born to lay their eggs. This process, called "arribada" for some turtle species, involves an increase in the number of female turtles coming together to nest. </p>

		<p>Despite their important ecological role, sea turtles face serious threats from human activities, such as egg poaching, habitat destruction, and unintentional capture by fishing gear. Therefore, intensive conservation efforts are necessary to protect sea turtles, ensure their survival, and maintain the overall balance of the marine ecosystem.</p>

			<h3>LEATHERBACK</h3>
			<img src="lh.jpg">
			<p>The leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) is one of the fascinating and unique species of sea turtles. Distinguished by its distinctive leathery shell, it is the largest among all sea turtle species. Adults can reach lengths of over 2 meters and weigh more than 900 kilograms. Its thin and flexible shell, which resembles skin, is an adaptation that helps the leatherback turtle regulate its body temperature in colder waters. The color of their skin varies, including black, dark brown, or gray, and can change over time. The leatherback turtle has a specialized diet, primarily consuming jellyfish and other soft-bodied marine creatures with the aid of its unique mouth structure. They can be found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide, showcasing remarkable migratory capabilities during feeding or nesting seasons.</p>

		<h3>FLATBACK</h3>
			<img src="penyu2.jpg">
			<p>The flatback turtle (Natator depressus) is a type of sea turtle characterized by its distinctive flat and wide shell compared to other turtle species. In general, this turtle can be recognized by its smooth and flattened shell. Flatback turtles are typically found in the coastal waters of northern Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the northern Pacific Islands. The name "flatback" refers to the flatter shape of its shell, providing a specific adaptation for life in shallow waters. The size of flatback turtles is generally smaller compared to some other turtle species, with a shell length of about 80 to 100 centimeters. They have a broad and round head with large eyes. Flatback turtles exhibit diverse feeding habits, consuming crabs, mollusks, and various marine organisms. T</p>

		<h2>INFORMATION</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Turtles are a group of marine reptiles that encompass several species with distinctive characteristics, unique adaptations, and crucial roles in the marine ecosystem. This group includes species such as the green turtle, loggerhead turtle, hawksbill turtle, flatback turtle, and leatherback turtle. Turtles can be found in tropical and subtropical waters worldwide. The main characteristic of turtles is their hard and scaly shell, except for the leatherback turtle, which has a shell covered in skin. Turtles have the unique ability to breathe using lungs and must surface to take a breath. They also demonstrate impressive migration capabilities, often traveling thousands of nautical miles for feeding or nesting.</p>

		<p>Nesting is a crucial moment in the life of a turtle, where females return to the beach where they were born to lay eggs. This process often involves burying the eggs in the sandy shore, and after hatching, turtle hatchlings must navigate various threats to reach the sea. Turtles have a varied diet, including foods such as jellyfish, crustaceans, mollusks, and seagrass, depending on the species.</p>

		<p>Although turtles play a vital role in maintaining the balance of the marine ecosystem by controlling the populations of some marine animals, they also face various threats from human activities. These threats include egg poaching, coastal habitat destruction, bycatch from fishing gear, and marine pollution. Therefore, conservation efforts and the protection of turtle habitats are crucial. Many organizations and communities worldwide work hard to safeguard turtles and their habitats, promote sustainable fishing practices, and raise awareness to support the survival of sea turtles. Through sustainable conservation efforts, we can ensure that turtles continue to contribute to biodiversity and the sustainability of the marine ecosystem.</p>
